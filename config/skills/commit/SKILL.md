## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

## Your task

1. Review the staged and unstaged changes
2. If there are unstaged changes that should be included, stage them with `git add`
3. Write a concise commit message that:
   - Summarizes the "why" rather than the "what"
   - Follows the style of recent commits
   - Is 1-2 sentences max
4. Create the commit with the message ending with:

```

```

5. Show the final `git status` to confirm
